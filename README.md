# Hospital_Management_SQL_Database


This project is aimed at developing a simple clinic management system using Java and a relational database. The system allows for the
management of patients, doctors, and appointments. It provides functionality to add new patients with auto-generated unique IDs and stores
their relevant information such as name, gender, date of birth, address, phone number, and email. Doctors can also be added with their 
respective details, including specialization. The system enables the scheduling of appointments between patients and doctors, ensuring 
referential integrity by using foreign key constraints. Users can view and manage appointments based on date and search for patient or 
doctor information. The project focuses on implementing database operations, handling SQL statements, and managing connections to perform 
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations efficiently.

Our main branch englobes the code used to create, populate and implement the database in Java, while our DB_INFO branch is the packages and jar files used.
